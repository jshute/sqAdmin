We Make History Site Management Help
---

***Hi Col. Scott! This guide should help with the basics of keeping We Make
History up to date.***

### Information Pages ###

Information pages are the basic type of content on the new We Make History site. They differ from event pages which are similar but have extra fields for things like date, time and location.

Clicking on "Pages" in the sidebar will bring up a list of all the current information pages. From here pages can be created, deleted and modified. Editing or creating a page brings up a form with certain attributes that affect how it's displayed on the website. Here is the basic layout and how it translates into the form:

![Information page example](info-page-example.png)

I'll do my best to describe these attributes below:

<div class="highlight" markdown="1">

#### Page Name
The page name is what shows in the website's navagation.  It's also used for google.

#### Online
Checking the box publishes it to the live website. Unchecking the box allows you to save it as a draft and come back later without it being live.

#### Parent Page
Changing the parent page simply changes which drop-down this page is categorized under.

#### Description Box
This description text from the page will appear in Google search results. For events, it's also the short excerpt shown on the homepage.

#### Main Image
Selecting a main image gives the page a picture up top that is the width of the screen.  See editing photos for a detailed description of how to do this.

#### Heading
The type right above the content.

#### Content
The content editing box changes the content of the page.

#### Video
If you were to want a YouTube video linked to the page, simply paste YouTube video ID in the box.  A "how to" find a video ID is linked below the video box on the edit screen.

#### Images 1, 2, and 3
Uploading the images changes the images on the pages.

#### Linked Pages
The linked pages section allows each page on the site to be linked to other pages.

#### Tracking
Finally, the tracking section at the bottom is just a place for internal notes. That section is not displayed anywhere public on the site.  But, for example, if you wanted to make yourself a note to remind yourself to do something, this is a good place to put it.

### Managing Events ###

When the event date has passed, the event will automatically be moved to the recent events section. Working with events is pretty similar to working with pages but they have some extra information needed in the form such as date, time and location. These are the event specific fields:

<div class="highlight" markdown="1">

Event Data
===

***The event edit screen contains all the same options as the information page type with the following additions...***

#### Event Begin and End Dates
The "begins" and "ends" dates must be inputted in MM/DD/YYYY format.

#### Hours Info
This box is small because it is designed to be read at a glance. For example, "November 16th and 17th (school groups), November 18th 10am-4:30 pm (general public)."

#### Location Info
Again, this box is small. It is designed to hold info such as "Schnepf Farms, Queen Creek, AZ."

#### Location Link
This is for Google maps to show up on the page. Just find the location in Google maps and then copy and paste the link.

#### Admission
This box is designed to hold information such as "Passes will be available at the event for $15 each. Ages 3 and under are free and do not need a pass."

</div>

### The Homepage ###

The homepage is a slightly special type of page. It can't be deleted and it's formatted a little differently. The homepage includes a list of upcoming and recent events. This list is automatically generated from the events on the site.

**Of note:** the heading and content sections of the home page are superimposed on the main image. Therefore, they are not designed to be very long.

### Working with Photos ###

Before you can select a photo to display on pages, it must be uploaded.  Select "Files" in the sidebar. That will bring up a list of different folders.  Important: each event should have its own folder to prevent future headaches.  You can create a folder, or select one, then you can create a sub-folder for event year if you wish.  Once you are in the location you want the picture to be, click "upload" and follow the prompts.  Now that your picture is uploaded, go back to edit the page you wish to add the photo and click on "pick files." That will bring up available folders. You will then find the picture exactly where you saved it.

### Working with Unconverted Pages

A lot of the pages on We Make History are still not converted over to the new system. The way they are linked in the header and footer is by putting the full URL to the page in the "URL Slug" field under the "Advanced" section when editing pages. The URL will be used in the header and footer instead of the page content. We can use this to stage pages and only convert them over to the new system when we're ready.
